    <body>
The government appointed a newcomer to politics with the aim of settling a city on the wild land of {{ city }}.

His first mission will be to connect {{ city }} with the rest of the world using roads.

Then, he must order the construction of housing, industries and shops to attract people and populate the city.

The final objective of the government with {{ city }} is to find the best city model to make the citizens happy. If the project is successful, the developed model will be applied in cities across the country.

We wish good luck to our new mayor.
